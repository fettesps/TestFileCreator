# Test File Creator
A desktop application for generating a large number of test files written in C# / .Net Core. 

## Purpose:
Primarily created for QA testing scenarios where you need a large set of unique files.  This application will generate any number of text files containing large amounts of unique lorem ipsum text.  Currently it supports only text files but in time I hope to support Word documents and other file types as well as the ability to generate files of any file size.
